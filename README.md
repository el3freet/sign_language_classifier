# Sign-Language-MNIST_CNN-Keras

hi 

I'm happy to share that I have finished my last project in SYNC INTERN'S 

Sign Language Classification Naveen Kumar



Sign languages are languages that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning, instead of spoken words. Sign languages are expressed through manual articulation in combination with non-manual markers. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their grammar and lexicon. Sign languages are not universal and are usually not mutually intelligible, although there are also similarities among different sign languages. 



-in this project, I classified the alphabet letters using CNN 







Tools used :



Keras 

Matplotlib

Tensorflow 

LabelBinarizer

ImageDataGenerator

confusion_matrix



It was good work I hope you get the best benefit
